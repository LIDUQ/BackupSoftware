Dreams Are the Stuff Life Is Made Of

　　梦想构造生活

　　I believe I'm a very lucky man.

　　我相信自己是一个幸运的人。

　　My entire life has been lived in the healthy 
area between too little and too much. I've never 
experienced financial or emotional insecurity, 
but everything I have, I've attained by my own 
work, not through indulgence, inheritance or
privilege.
